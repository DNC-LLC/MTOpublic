/* To enable prototyping of the bootstrapping loop of our reanalysis

 * This script is based largely on two scripts provided by Nancy A.
 * Sampson 12/7/2015: MTO_makedata_10112013.sas & MTO_table4_alt.sas.

 * Our bootstrap loop resamples the PTSD imputation model from its

 *       make this code work standalone.)
 */

/* We include Ptsd_MTO_youth.sas, which has been modified by
 * COMMENTING OUT the section of code that reads the original
 * imputation coefficients from a CSV file and assembles a
 * model RHS &formula.  By decoupling the &formula from the
 * CSV file in this way, we effectively turn &formula into a
 * PARAMETER of 'Ptsd_MTO_youth.sas'.  With only this minor
 * modification to the original authors' code, we are able to
 * invoke it simply by %include'ing it after setting a value
 * for &folder.  (That value-setting occurs within the bootstrap
 * loop of 'simbetas.sas', followed immediately by an %include
 * of THIS script.)  This software design is motivated by the
 * desire to achieve our reanalysis with as little modification
 * as possible of the original authors' code.
