NOTE: The input data set is subset by WHERE, OBS, or FIRSTOBS. This provides a completely separate analysis of the subset. It does 
      not provide a statistically valid subpopulation or domain analysis, where the total number of units in the subpopulation is 
      not known with certainty. If you want a domain analysis, you should include the DOMAIN variables in a DOMAIN statement.
NOTE: PROC SURVEYLOGISTIC is modeling the probability that DSM_PTS='(1) ENDORSED'.
NOTE: Convergence criterion (GCONV=1E-8) satisfied.
NOTE: The data set WORK.BETASA1R1S40 has 24 observations and 2 variables.
NOTE: The data set WORK.COVSA1R1S40 has 24 observations and 25 variables.
