Reproduction of MTO Final Youth Survey analysis

This file is to be used to collect instructions for steps in the reproduction
and forensic re-analysis of the MTO PTSD results reported in Kessler et al 2014
JAMA paper.  Each analytic step should be documented separately below, with the
sole aim of supporting reproduction of our full analysis by a third party.

A high-level overview of key files and subdirectories in this repository is to
be found (and maintained) at the very bottom of this file.  This is intended to
support an initial appreciation of the repository contents; brief descriptions
of individual files (or suitable groups thereof) should be given in the commit
message accompanying each initial commits.  Thus, a useful brief description of
any committed file should be available through the command:

 `git log -1 --pretty=%s <filename>`

## Reproduction
