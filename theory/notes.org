* Reading notes from Matt Sciandra's Jan 11, 2016 documentation
  1. We should enquire as to any specific problems expected when running this code on SAS v9.4
  2. Redoing the imputation w/ and w/o tract clustering will make interesting comparison
  3. Align our paper's terminology with Mr. Sciandra's p. 5: /LPV/, /TRV/, /control/
  4. Ensure alignment where necessary as well with the collection-phase terms on pp. 5-6
  5. Check the weighted response rate (90.0%) vs JAMA paper; I recall something in the 80s
  6. The imputation described in Section 4.2 is truly remarkable:
     - fully 22% (absolute count) of the imputed individuals were completely made up!
     - (TODO: calculate this figure on a weighted basis, also)
     - How could anyone expect this to do anything but magnify RNG errors?
     - **This makes an interviewed-case (NB, /not/ 'complete-case') analysis essential**
     - **Changing the imputation seed is also essential**
  7. Our paper must anticipate and circumvent the original authors' potential misuse of 'false discovery rate' as a defense against our argument.
